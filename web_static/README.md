# AirBnB Clone Web Static

This repository contains a series of HTML and CSS tasks for creating a web page layout that showcases various features and improvements. Each task builds upon the previous one, progressively enhancing the design, structure, and functionality of the web page.

## Task 0: Inline Styling

The task aims to create a basic HTML page layout with a header and a footer. The header is styled with a red color (#FF0000) and spans the full width of the page. The footer has a green color (#00FF00) and displays the text "Best School" both vertically and horizontally aligned.

**File:** `web_static/0-index.html`

Similar to Task 0, this task creates a header and footer using the style tag within the head tag of the HTML document. The layout and styling remain consistent with Task 0.

**File:** `web_static/1-index.html`

## Task 2: CSS Files

In this task, the header and footer are styled using separate CSS files (`2-common.css`, `2-header.css`, `2-footer.css`). This task introduces the concept of using external CSS files to manage the styling.

**Files:** `web_static/2-index.html`, `styles/2-common.css`, `styles/2-header.css`, `styles/2-footer.css`
